Orders Menu App
This is a simple Android Jetpack Compose project that demonstrates an interactive restaurant menu ordering system.

The app allows users to select food items from a menu, adjust their order quantities, and place an order. It dynamically tracks stock availability and updates menu items once the stock is depleted.

âž•âž– Increase/Decrease Orders: Each dish has "+" and "âˆ’" buttons to adjust the order quantity.

Item name stays black if stock is available.

Item name turns red when stock runs out.

âœ… Place Order:

Pressing the "Make Order" button finalizes the chosen items.

A toast message displays the ordered items.

Stock is updated accordingly.
